Hello everybody!

Its been a while since I wrote something in my own blog. Before anything else, I would like to apologize :( There is no plausible gain on blaming work and time constraints, I simply, didn't write here (_mea culpa_).

That being said, this is about to change: One of my goals for this year is to increase the blogging frequency. For the witty people wondering "isn't anything more than zero already being an 'increase'?" - yes, it is.

The fact that content was not published here does not mean that there was no content at all. I was involved with several webinars/webcasts, blog posts and other engagements over the year, for which I am not only humbled, but honored.

Some of those engagements/tasks were the following:

- [Demystifying CEF](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/blogs/vip-perspectives/2019/03/28/demystifying-cef?cid=cln-smtwt-blog-demystifyingcef-text-4682)
- [EIGRP Unveiled](https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-events/webcast-eigrp-unveiled/ba-p/3806876)
- [Getting to know SD-WAN](https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-events/community-live-getting-to-know-cisco-sd-wan/ba-p/3994420)
- [Meet the author: Peter Pal√∫ch](https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-documents/meet-the-authors-slides-peter-paluch-co-author-of-ccie-routing/ta-p/3950704)
- Several episodes in [Cisco Champion Radio](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/events-webinars/influencer-hub/cisco-champions-radio-podcasts.html)
- [Translated blogs (Spanish) in Cisco Learning Network](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/espanol/blog/) (anything published by me or Rigo Villa)
- Attempted (and failed) the CCDE practical exam twice this year
- Attempted and passed CCIE R&S Written exam (December)
- Attempted and passed CCIE SP Written exam (January)
- **A lot** of work (new role and project to lead, many new things to learn and manage)

Regardless of what was listed here, there is no way to excuse it. I reiterate my apologies to you. This year I will pay more attention to the blog and, I will do my best to create new content and share it with all of you.

Leaving those apologies behind, there is more to share: earlier this year (this sounds weird, as the year is only 5 days old) I have posted a tweet with some of my goals for this year. Yes, some, as I might (and I am sure I will) come up with some others on the fly (those are the funny ones).

Those "other" kinds of content could be blogs, videos, or similar outputs, as long as they would be helpful for you (like more content about SD-WAN :D). Many cool things are coming!

Oh, before I forget. I have excellent news: Got selected as #CiscoChampion for this year! :D (I am glad I did make the cut and they did not pull the plug on me).

That would be all for now, but there is more to come.

Thanks for reading! :D
